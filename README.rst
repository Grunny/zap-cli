ZAP CLI
=======

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Grunny/zap-cli.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/Grunny/zap-cli

A commandline tool that wraps the OWASP ZAP API for controlling ZAP and
executing quick, targeted attacks.

Installation
============

To install the latest release from PyPI, you can run the following command: 

::

    pip install --upgrade zapcli

To install the latest development version of ZAP CLI, you can run the
following:

::

    pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Grunny/zap-cli.git

To install ZAP CLI for development, including the dependencies needed
in order to run unit tests, clone this repository and use
``pip install -e .[dev]``.

Usage
=====

To use ZAP CLI, you need to set the port ZAP runs on (defaults to 8090) and
the path to the folder in which ZAP is installed. These can be set either as
commandline parameters or with the environment variables ``ZAP_PORT`` and
``ZAP_PATH``. If you have an API key set for ZAP, this can likewise be set
either as a commandline parameter or with the ``ZAP_API_KEY`` environment
variable.

ZAP CLI can then be used with the following commands:

Getting started running a scan
------------------------------
In order to run a scan, you can use either the ``active-scan`` or the ``quick-scan``
command. The ``active-scan`` only runs an active scan against a URL that is already
in ZAP's site tree (i.e. has already been opened using the ``open-url`` command or
found by running the ``spider``). The ``quick-scan`` command is intended to be a way
to run quick scans of a site with most options contained within a single command
(including being able to start and shutdown ZAP before and after), so you can do
everything in one go. Without any other options passed to the command, ``quick-scan``
will open the URL to make sure it's in the site tree, run an active scan, and will
output any found alerts.

As an example, to run a quick scan of a URL that will open and spider the URL, scan
recursively, exclude URLs matching a given regex, and only use XSS and SQLi scanners,
you could run:

::

    $ zap-cli quick-scan -s xss,sqli --spider -r -e "some_regex_pattern" http://127.0.0.1/
    [INFO]            Running a quick scan for http://127.0.0.1/
    [INFO]            Issues found: 1
    +----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Alert                            | Risk   |   CWE ID | URL                                                                             |

    +----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The above example is equivalent to running the following commands in order:

::

    $ zap-cli open-url http://127.0.0.1/
    [INFO]            Accessing URL http://127.0.0.1/
    $ zap-cli exclude "some_regex_pattern"
    $ zap-cli spider http://127.0.0.1/

    $ zap-cli active-scan --scanners xss,sqli --recursive http://127.0.0.1/

    $ zap-cli alerts

    +----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The ``quick-scan`` command also has a ``--self-contained`` option (or ``-sc`` for short)
which will first try to start ZAP if it isn't running already and shutdown ZAP once the
scan is finished. For example:

::

    $ zap-cli quick-scan --self-contained --spider -r -s xss http://127.0.0.1/
    [INFO]            Starting ZAP daemon
    [INFO]            Running a quick scan for http://127.0.0.1/
    [INFO]            Issues found: 1

    +----------------------------------+--------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    [INFO]            Shutting down ZAP daemon

Extra start options
-------------------
You can also pass extra options to the start command of ZAP using ``--start-options`` or ``-o``
with commands that allow it. For example, to start ZAP with a custom API key you could use:

::

    $ zap-cli start --start-options '-config api.key=12345'

Or to run a self-contained quick scan (that will start ZAP and shut it down after the scan
is complete) with a custom API key, you could use:

::

    $ zap-cli --api-key 12345 quick-scan --self-contained -o '-config api.key=12345' -s xss http://127.0.0.1/

Or to run the same scan with the API key disabled:

::

    $ zap-cli quick-scan -sc -o '-config api.disablekey=true' -s xss http://127.0.0.1/

Running scans as authenticated users
------------------------------------
In order to run a scan as an authenticated user, first configure the authentication method and users for
a context using the ZAP UI (see the `ZAP help page <https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAuthentication>`_
for more information). Once the authentication method and users are prepared, you can then export the context
with the configured authentication method so it can be imported and used to run authenticated scans with ZAP CLI.

You can export a context with the authentication method and users configured either through the ZAP UI or using the
``context export`` ZAP CLI command. For example, to export a context with the name DevTest to a file, you could run:

::

    $ zap-cli context export --name DevTest --file-path /home/user/DevTest.context

To import the saved context for use with ZAP CLI later, you could run:

::

    $ zap-cli context import /home/user/DevTest.context

After importing the context with the configured authentication method and users, you can then provide the context name
and user name to the ``spider``, ``active-scan``, and ``quick-scan`` commands to run the scans while authenticated as
the given user. For example:

::

    $ zap-cli context import /home/user/DevTest.context
    $ zap-cli open-url "http://localhost/"
    $ zap-cli spider --context-name DevTest --user-name SomeUser "http://localhost"
    $ zap-cli active-scan --recursive -c DevTest -u SomeUser "http://localhost"
    $ zap-cli quick-scan --recursive --spider -c DevTest -u SomeUser "http://localhost"
